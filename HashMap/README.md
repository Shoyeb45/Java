## This folder contains simple implementation of Hash Map

There are two files :
1. `HashMap.java` - Which contains the implementation of Hash Map data structure
2. `Implementation.java` - Which contains some code to test Hash Map data structure.

There is one folder:
1. `HashMapDoc` - Which contains the documentation of the `HashMap` data structure.

I have deployed the documentation on vercel.
