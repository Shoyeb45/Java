# Static keyword / Modifier in java

- Static keyword can be applied to `variables`, `blocks`, `methods` and `inner classes`.

> Components of a class
1. Variables
2. Blocks
3. Methods

JVM is divided into 3 categories:
1. Class loader subsysem (3 activities)
2. Runtime data area(5 areas)
3. Execution engine(3 componenets)

Classloader subsystem performs 3 activities: 
### 1) Loading : loads the files into metaspace 
1. Bootstrap class loader : Repsonsible for loading JDK classes
2. Extension class loader : Responsible for loading classes that are an exension of the standard core java class.
3. Application class loader : Responsible for an application specific.

> Classloader work on the principle of **deligation hierarchy model**. The is, the request to load a class will be first deligated to its parents class loader. It only loads the class if the parent did not find find the class to load.

### 2) Linking : Performs verification, preparation and (optionally) resolution
1. Verify 
    - Bytecode Verifier will verify whether the generated bytecode is proper or not
    - If a calss fails verification then `VerifyError` is thrown

2. Prepare
    - Memory will be allocated for static variables and default value will be assigned.
3. Resolve
    - All symbolic memory referenced are replaces with the original reffernces from method area.

### 3) Initialisation : Static variables will be assigned with this original values and static blocks will be executed

#### <u>Runtime Data Area</u>:
1. Method area : class metadata, code for methods/constructor
2. Heap Area: Objects, instance variables, static members
3. Stack area : Stack frames for methods, local variables
4. Program Counter registers : Address of instructions
5. Native Method stack : Native method information

#### <u>Execution Engine</u>
- The JVM then involves the `main()` method of the class & executes is using the execution engine. The executino engine executes the bytecodes loaded into the memory area using an interpreter and JIT compiler.
1. Java Interpreter : It interprets the non-hotspot bytecodes to MLL codes
2. JIT Compiler : It computes the hotspot bytecode to MLL code
3. Garbage Collector: It collects and removes unreferenced objects.
