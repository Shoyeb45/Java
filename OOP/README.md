## Data Encapsulation in Java

- Encapsulation referes to the process of providing security to the most important components of an object
- In java, the most important of a class/object are the data members.
- Secutiry to the data members can be provided by preventing direct access and providing controlled access
- Direct access can be prevented by decalaring the data members as private. Controlled access can be provided by using 'public setters()' and getters or accessors and mutators
- This is also refered to as data hiding as the data members are hidden from other classes.
